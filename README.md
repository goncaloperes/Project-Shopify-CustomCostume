I wanted to start dropshipping items from AliExpress, but didn't want to spend time with hosting problems, so I have decided to go for Shopify.
  To facilitate the process of adding the products to the store, I have used Oberlo.
  I setted up the Bing, Yandex and Google Webmaster for the website.
  I have setted up the Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel in order to control data related with the clients.
  In order to increase the Sales it was ued 5 Sales Channels: Amazon, Buy Button, Messenger, Wish and the Website itself.
  It was also created Social Media accounts to share relevant content.
